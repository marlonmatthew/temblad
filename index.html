      Our first album Nevercrown was released in 2016 while I was studying abroad in Chile. This is a recollection of
      events that occured following that album release.
      <br><br>
      Upon returning from South America, I purchased some
      starter microphones and the Presonus Studio 192 recording interface. We got busy tracking demos
      at our rehearsal space as I was wrapping up my last semester of college.
      <br><br>
      In December of 2016, things were starting to get rough. Although there was the minute sense of accomplishment
      graduating from San Diego State University, I was living at our rehearsal space and going through a
      depressing breakup. This wasn't the only time self destruction was a priority for me, but my drinking was
      becoming the worst it has ever been. My second home was a bar not too far
      from the rehearsal space, and I was becoming a regular kareoke rock star in my wildest escapes from reality.
      Jobless and without any real motivation outside of music, jamming at the rehearsal space and putting together
      new songs was the only thing keeping me going... well, that, and unemployment benefits. In a way, the excessive
      imbibing
      helped me get through it, but I would never rely upon or condone that kind of coping
      mechanism these days. Something came out of all of this... call it some kind of sick determination if you will.
      <br><br>
      In January of 2017, the first demos of the song "To Unbecome Empty in Rot" (track 1 from Hallucignosis) were
      structured. Lorenzo and I had a
      very raw method of recording improvisational jam sessions. I would go back to the sessions later and identify
      all the magical parts where our playing was at its catchiest or most interesting. From there, I would spend more
      time structuring those parts into preliminary song structures. This structure was referred to as "Snide" at the
      time and for many years after.
      <br><br>
      There were no lyrics at the time, but there was plenty going on that inspired the direction
      towards a more violent and chaotic approach with the music. We were wanting to get away from the more
      bouncy/campy grooves that were present on the previous album. The first version of the Snide demo lacked any
      structure
      at all, and some riffs were starting to tread into more blackened doom territory, much like my life at the time.
      It wasn't until the very end of vocal tracking for the album that the
      song was still undergoing its final revisions and structure changes, practically 6 years later.
      <br><br>For those who are curious to hear the song in its original demo state, well wait a second, the album
      isn't
      even out yet.
      <br><br>
      As the songwriting process developed further, To Unbecome Empty In Rot became the story of self-antipathy, and
      the reinvigoration of purpose through music. Lorenzo requested assistance with the lyrics for this song, and so
      they were finally written in 2022 as I was
      sitting at a neighborhood bar, reaching back to vivid memories and recurring blackouts of 2017. I must admit
      that from 2016 to 2022, the boozing
      periodically had gotten entirely out of hand, that being the roller coaster nature of alcoholism. I got off the
      ride once again in late 2022.
      <br><br>
      As an easter egg of sorts, the title To Unbecome Empty in Rot is a
      reference to the last line of lyrics from the final song on the
      Nevercrown album, Giest. Lorenzo wanted to use those lyrics as a title to segue the whole transformation
      from
      Nevercrown to Hallucignosis. This is the only track on Hallucignosis where I wrote lyrics and contributed any
      vocals.
      <br><br>
      The song Supramundane Predations, track 6 off Hallucignosis, also was first demoed out in 2017, following the
      same improvisational process and
      shrouded within an even more ominous atmosphere.
      <br><br>
      More writings about Hallucignosis will come, so if you made it this far, I thank YOU! Witness bedlam in 2023!

      We are so thrilled to finally release this body of work which was seven years in the making. More to come soon!
      <br><br>
      In other news, we also would like to announce the recent addition of Matt Ponder on bass. You may know of him
      from
      his band <a href="https://genestealergrind.bandcamp.com/">Genestealer</a>, who happens to be San Diego’s best
      grindcore band, hands down. We are so grateful to have him in the band as we are all close friends.

      We've been quiet on the internet...
      <br><br>
      But we have not been quiet where it really counts… in the studio. We finished recording all the songs for the
      next album. The mixing/mastering stage is currently underway. More info regarding our next album coming soon.
      <br><br>
      In regards to live performance, we have been rehearsing with a new bassist and have a complete set ready for
      live performance. The time for us to hit the stage again is soon coming… thanks for visiting us and stay
      tuned!

    <div id="post-content">
      The band has obviously been put on hold as far as live performances are concerned. However, songs for the
      upcoming second Temblad album are currently under production remotely. Big progress is being made and the wait
      will be well worth it. The compositions are taking shape in ways we never previously imagined. The envelope is
      constantly being pushed. We are proud of what we accomplished with Nevercrown, but the new material is the next
      level of Temblad in terms of songwriting and technical prowess. While we do miss playing shows and keeping up
      with our regular performance routine, Covid-19 has no means of slowing us down when it really boils down to it.
      Realistically, with the year coming closer to an end, we can reasonably expect the new album to drop sometime
      next year. Hopefully by that time shows will be happening again, but we aren’t counting on it. We may take part
      in some live streams in the future, so stay tuned!
