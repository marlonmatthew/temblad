          The two Temblad tracks on this were written in 2020 and recorded in 2023/2024. We were talking to <a href="https://ceruleanblackmetal.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Cerulean</a> for a while about doing a split, so we took two of the shortest songs we had. Like Hallucignosis, everything was tracked with our own gear at our own spots. Stephen Knapp from <a href="https://ceruleanblackmetal.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Cerulean</a> was kind enough to mix the whole split.

            The long-awaited follow-up to Nevercrown! Shifting from the anti-fundamentalist theme of before, the album
            title and concept describes the mutation of the human mind through hallucinogenic methods to attain death of
            the ego, reaching clandestine perception. In a direction more harsh and foreboding, Hallucignosis plunges
            from its first note into a pit of intricate riffs, relentless blasts, and averse vocalizations… witness

                Bandcamp</a>
            <br><br>
            In 2016, San Diego extreme metal band Temblad self-released their first album, Nevercrown. Featuring 14
            tracks, Nevercrown displays a modern take on the classic death and thrash metal styles. Lyrically and
            thematically, Nevercrown is an unyielding denouncement of fundamentalist ideologies and practices.
            <br><br>
            “A great addition to the burgeoning again thrash/death metal hybrid, this opus, and respectively band,
            stand proud in the lofty company of other outstanding practitioners (Dimesland, Vektor, Black Fast,
            Droid, Torrefy, Outcast, etc.) who have also chosen the more technical/progressive side of it to
            explore. Unlike those, our friends here stay more on death metal ground, but this can only be beneficial
            in their case as the Voivod-ish element sounds even more prominent in league with the more brutal ways
            of expression, giving this album a fine characteristic veneer.” – <a

            “It’s a pounding and intense album, the wall of sound created by the constantly blasting drums and
            heated guitar riffage is ever present and crushing. Even while breaking into groove sections, the
            intensity and rhythm of the grind is present, tracks like ‘Ships of Traitors’ and ‘Geist’ sound like
            wrecking balls flying out of your speakers. I can only imagine what it would be like seeing this
            palpable wall of death in person.” – <a
